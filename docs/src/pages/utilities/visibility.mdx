import { VisibilityBasic } from "../../examples/utilities/Visibility"

<CodeBlock code={VisibilityBasic}>
  <p>
    Set the <code>visibility</code> of elements with our visibility utilities.
    These utility classes do not modify the <code>display</code> value at all
    and do not affect layout â€“ <code>.invisible</code> elements still take up
    space in the page. Content will be hidden both visually and for assistive
    technology/screen reader users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply <code>.visible</code> or <code>.invisible</code> as needed.
  </p>
</CodeBlock>
